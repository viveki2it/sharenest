# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# The following keys must be escaped otherwise they will not be retrieved by
# the default I18n backend:
#
# true, false, on, off, yes, no
#
# Instead, surround them with single quotes.
#
# en:
#   'true': 'foo'
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide

Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned on your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. These Terms apply to all visitors, users and others who access or use the Service. Please read them carefully before using the Services"
    terms_h2: "Your Use of the Service"
    terms_p2: "By accessing or using the Service you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you are using the Services on behalf of an organization or entity (“Organization”), then you are agreeing to these Terms on behalf of that Organization and you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind the Organization to these Terms. In that case, “you” and “your” refers to you and that Organization."
    terms_p3: "You may use the Services only in compliance with these Terms. The Services may continue to change over time as we refine and add more features. We may stop, suspend, or modify the Services at any time without prior notice to you. We may also remove any content from our Services at our discretion."
    terms_h3: "Children’s Use of the Service"
    terms_p4: "ShareNest wants to protect the safety of children using the Services. To the extent applicable, ShareNest complies with applicable laws and regulations, including the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), which governs information gathering online from or about children under the age of 13. Verifiable consent from a child’s parent or guardian is required before collecting, using, or disclosing personal information from a child under the age of 13."
    terms_p5: "Consistent with the requirements of COPPA, in any instance where ShareNest asks for age and determines the user is under the age of 13, ShareNest will require a parent or guardian email address in order to send a consent form to the parent/guardian for verifiable consent before ShareNest collects any personal information from children under the age of 13."
    terms_p6: "Without obtaining verifiable parental consent, online contact information collected from a child is only used to respond directly on a one-time basis to a specific request from the child and is not used to re-contact the child and is not maintained in retrievable form by ShareNest."
    terms_p7: "In addition to obtaining verifiable consent according to the process described above, ShareNest does NOT:"
    olli_1: "collect personally identifiable offlinecontact information of a child under age 13 without prior parental consent."
    olli_2: "provide any personally identifiable information, regardless of its source, to any third-party for any purpose whatsoever concerning our Users under 13 years of age, unless otherwise disclosed to children and their parents during the information collection process."
    olli_3: "give children under age 13 the ability to publicly post or otherwise distribute personally identifiable contact information without prior parental consent."
    olli_4: "entice any child by the prospect of a special game, prize, or other activity to divulge more information than is needed to participate in the activity."
    terms_p8: "There are several exceptions that permit collection of a child’s e-mail address without receiving parental consent in advance:"
    ulli_1: "To provide the parents with notice and to seek consent for communications with the child. Note: this may require collection of the parent’s e-mail address as well."
    ulli_2: "To protect the safety of a child who is participating in the Services; i.e., in a message board"
    ulli_3: "To protect the Service or to respond to law enforcement; i.e., in the case of a Service compromise."
    terms_h4: "Data, Files & Your Privacy"
    terms_p9: "By using our Services you provide us with information, files, and folders that you submit to ShareNest (together, “Content”). You retain full ownership to your Content. We don’t claim any ownership to any of it. These Terms do not grant us any rights to your Content or intellectual property except for the rights that are needed to run the Services, as explained below. You give us your permission to do things you ask us to do with your Content, for example, hosting your Content, or analyzing your Content to create reports for you, the selected community(ies), non-profit organizations and schools identified by you as part of your registration process or us. It also includes design choices we make to technically administer our Services, for example, how we redundantly backup data to keep it safe. You give us the permissions we need to do those things to provide the Services. This permission also extends to trusted third parties we work with to provide the Services, which provides our storage space (again, only to provide the Services)."
    terms_p10: "To be clear, aside from the selected community(ies), non-profit organizations and schools identified by you as part of your registration process as community(ies), non-profit organizations and schools you are, wish to or will be associated with, and aside from other exceptions we identify in our Privacy Policy, no matter how the Services change, we won’t share your Content with others unless: (a) you direct us to; (b) we are required to by law or by valid legal process; or (c) we need to in order to provide you the Services. How we collect and use your information generally is also explained in our Privacy Policy."
    terms_p11: "You retain full ownership to your Content, but you agree to grant us a worldwide, non-exclusive, irrevocable, transferable, perpetual, royalty-free license (with the right to sublicense) to use, copy, reproduce, process, adapt, modify, publish, transmit, edit, translate, make derivatives, display and distribute such Content in connection with providing the Service to you and other users in accordance with your settings on the Service. In connection with providing the Service, we may modify or adapt your Content in order to transmit, display or distribute it over computer networks and in various media and/or make changes to your Content as are necessary to conform and adapt that Content to any requirements or limitations of any networks, devices, services or media."

No waiver of any sections of these Terms shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and ShareNest’s failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right of provision. We may provide notifications, whether these are required by law of are for marketing or other business related purposes, to you via email notice, written or hard copy notice, or through posting of such notice on our website, as determined by us in our sole discretion."
