          <h1>TERMS OF SERVICE</h1>
          <p>
            These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your access to and use of ShareNest (“ShareNest”, “we” or “our”) websites, services, and applications (collectively the “Service”). Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned on your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. These Terms apply to all visitors, users and others who access or use the Service. Please read them carefully before using the Services
          </p>
          <h1>Your Use of the Service</h1>
          <p>
            By accessing or using the Service you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you are using the Services on behalf of an organization or entity (“Organization”), then you are agreeing to these Terms on behalf of that Organization and you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind the Organization to these Terms. In that case, “you” and “your” refers to you and that Organization.
          </p>
          <p>
            You may use the Services only in compliance with these Terms. The Services may continue to change over time as we refine and add more features. We may stop, suspend, or modify the Services at any time without prior notice to you. We may also remove any content from our Services at our discretion.
          </p>
          <h1>Children’s Use of the Service</h1>
          <p>
            ShareNest wants to protect the safety of children using the Services. To the extent applicable, ShareNest complies with applicable laws and regulations, including the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), which governs information gathering online from or about children under the age of 13. Verifiable consent from a child’s parent or guardian is required before collecting, using, or disclosing personal information from a child under the age of 13.
          </p>
          <p>
            Consistent with the requirements of COPPA, in any instance where ShareNest asks for age and determines the user is under the age of 13, ShareNest will require a parent or guardian email address in order to send a consent form to the parent/guardian for verifiable consent before ShareNest collects any personal information from children under the age of 13.
          </p>
          <p>
            Without obtaining verifiable parental consent, online contact information collected from a child is only used to respond directly on a one-time basis to a specific request from the child and is not used to re-contact the child and is not maintained in retrievable form by ShareNest.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition to obtaining verifiable consent according to the process described above, ShareNest does NOT:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>collect personally identifiable offlinecontact information of a child under age 13 without prior parental consent.</li>
            <li>provide any personally identifiable information, regardless of its source, to any third-party for any purpose whatsoever concerning our Users under 13 years of age, unless otherwise disclosed to children and their parents during the information collection process.</li>
            <li>give children under age 13 the ability to publicly post or otherwise distribute personally identifiable contact information without prior parental consent.</li>
            <li>entice any child by the prospect of a special game, prize, or other activity to divulge more information than is needed to participate in the activity.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            There are several exceptions that permit collection of a child’s e-mail address without receiving parental consent in advance:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>To provide the parents with notice and to seek consent for communications with the child. Note: this may require collection of the parent’s e-mail address as well.</li>
            <li>To protect the safety of a child who is participating in the Services; i.e., in a message board</li>
            <li>To protect the Service or to respond to law enforcement; i.e., in the case of a Service compromise.</li>
          </ul>
          <h1>Data, Files & Your Privacy</h1>
          <p>By using our Services you provide us with information, files, and folders that you submit to ShareNest (together, “Content”). You retain full ownership to your Content. We don’t claim any ownership to any of it. These Terms do not grant us any rights to your Content or intellectual property except for the rights that are needed to run the Services, as explained below. You give us your permission to do things you ask us to do with your Content, for example, hosting your Content, or analyzing your Content to create reports for you, the selected community(ies), non-profit organizations and schools identified by you as part of your registration process or us. It also includes design choices we make to technically administer our Services, for example, how we redundantly backup data to keep it safe. You give us the permissions we need to do those things to provide the Services. This permission also extends to trusted third parties we work with to provide the Services, which provides our storage space (again, only to provide the Services).</p>
          <p>To be clear, aside from the selected community(ies), non-profit organizations and schools identified by you as part of your registration process as community(ies), non-profit organizations and schools you are, wish to or will be associated with, and aside from other exceptions we identify in our Privacy Policy, no matter how the Services change, we won’t share your Content with others unless: (a) you direct us to; (b) we are required to by law or by valid legal process; or (c) we need to in order to provide you the Services. How we collect and use your information generally is also explained in our Privacy Policy.</p>
          <p>You retain full ownership to your Content, but you agree to grant us a worldwide, non-exclusive, irrevocable, transferable, perpetual, royalty-free license (with the right to sublicense) to use, copy, reproduce, process, adapt, modify, publish, transmit, edit, translate, make derivatives, display and distribute such Content in connection with providing the Service to you and other users in accordance with your settings on the Service. In connection with providing the Service, we may modify or adapt your Content in order to transmit, display or distribute it over computer networks and in various media and/or make changes to your Content as are necessary to conform and adapt that Content to any requirements or limitations of any networks, devices, services or media.</p>
          <p>You, and not ShareNest, are responsible for maintaining and protecting all of your content. ShareNest will not be liable for any loss or corruption of your Content, or for any costs or expenses associated with backing up or restoring any of your stuff.</p>
          <h1>ShareNest’s license to you</h1>
          <p>Subject to these Terms, ShareNest gives you a personal, worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable, non-sublicensable and non-exclusive license to use the Service. We reserve all rights not expressly granted in these Terms in the Service. We can terminate this license at any time for any reason or for no reason.</p>
          <p>Some use of our Service might require you to download a client software package (“Software”). ShareNest hereby grants you a limited, nonexclusive, nontransferable, revocable license to use the Software, solely to access the Services. Your license to use the Software is automatically revoked if you violate these Terms in a manner that implicates our intellectual property rights. We hereby reserve all rights not expressly granted in these Terms. You must not reverse engineer or decompile the Software, nor attempt to do so, nor assist anyone else to do so. Our Services may update the Software on your device automatically when a new version is available.</p>
          <h1>Your conduct</h1>
          <p>You are solely responsible for your conduct, the content of your files and folders, and your communications with others while using the Services. For example, it’s your responsibility to ensure that you have the rights or permission needed to comply with these Terms. We may choose to review content for compliance with our community guidelines, but you acknowledge that ShareNest has no obligation to monitor any information on the Services. We are not responsible for the accuracy, completeness, appropriateness, or legality of files, user posts, or any other information you may be able to access using the Services.</p>
          <p>You agree not to post Content that: (i) may create a risk of harm, loss, physical or mental injury, emotional distress, death, disability, disfigurement, or physical or mental illness to you, to any other person, or to any animal; (ii) may create a risk of any other loss or damage to any person or property; (iii) seeks to harm or exploit children by exposing them to inappropriate content, asking for personally identifiable details or otherwise; (iv) may constitute or contribute to a crime or tort; (v) contains any information or content that we deem to be unlawful, harmful, abusive, racially or ethnically offensive, defamatory, infringing, invasive of personal privacy or publicity rights, harassing, humiliating to other people (publicly or otherwise), libelous, threatening, profane, or otherwise objectionable; (vi) contains any information or content that is illegal (including, without limitation, the disclosure of insider information under securities law or of another party’s trade secrets); (vii) contains any information or content that you do not have a right to make available under any law or under contractual or fiduciary relationships; or (viii) contains any information or content that you know is not correct and current. You agree that any Content that you post does not and will not violate rights of any kind, including without limitation any intellectual property rights or rights of privacy. We reserve the right, but are not obligated, to reject and/or remove any Content that we believe, in our sole discretion, violates these provisions.</p>
          <p>We reserve the right at all times, but are not obligated, to remove or refuse to distribute any Content on the Service including your stuff.

          <h1>Your Account</h1>

Your ShareNest account gives you access to the Services and functionality that we may establish and maintain from time to time and in our sole discretion.

If you connect to ShareNest with a third-party service, you give us permission to access and use your information from that service as permitted by that service, and to store your log-in credentials for that service. You may never use another user’s account without permission.</p>

          <h1>No Warranty – ShareNest is Available “AS-IS”</h1>

For example, THE SERVICES AND SOFTWARE ARE PROVIDED “AS IS”, AT YOUR OWN RISK, WITHOUT EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTY OR CONDITION OF ANY KIND. WE ALSO DISCLAIM ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT. (We are not shouting – it’s just that these disclaimers are really important, so we want to highlight them). ShareNest will have no responsibility for any harm to your computer system, loss or corruption of data, or other harm that results from your access to or use of the Services or Software. Some states do not allow the types of disclaimers in this paragraph, so they may not apply to you.</p>
          <h1>Limitation of Liability</h1>
          <p>TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL SHARENEST, ITS AFFILIATES, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, SUPPLIERS OR LICENSORS BE LIABLE FOR (A) ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY OR CONSEQUENTIAL (INCLUDING LOSS OF USE, DATA, BUSINESS, OR PROFITS) DAMAGES, REGARDLESS OF LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER OR NOT LEVER HAS BEEN WARNED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, AND EVEN IF A REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE; (B) AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS RELATING TO THE SERVICES MORE THAN THE GREATER OF $20 OR THE AMOUNTS PAID BY YOU TO SHARENEST FOR THE PAST THREE MONTHS OF THE SERVICES IN QUESTION.

          <h1>Miscellaneous Legal Terms</h1>
          <p>These Terms and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by us without restriction. Any attempted transfer or assignment by you will be null and void.</p>
          <p>In the unlikely event that ShareNest has not been able to resolve a dispute it has with you after attempting to do so informally, we each agree to resolve any claim, dispute, or controversy (excluding any ShareNest claims for injunctive or other equitable relief) arising out of or in connection with or relating to this Agreement, or the breach or alleged breach thereof (collectively, “Claims”), by binding arbitration by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) in the city of Miami, Florida under the commercial rules then in effect for the AAA, except as provided herein. The award rendered by the arbitrator shall include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys’ fees and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses, and any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Nothing in this Section shall be deemed as preventing ShareNest from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts as necessary to protect any of ShareNest’s proprietary interests. ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES’ INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS APLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. YOU AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU AND LEVER ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.</p>
          <p>You agree that the Service is based in Florida; and these Terms are governed by the internal substantive laws of the State of Florida, without respect to its conflict of laws principles. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.</p>
          <p>These Terms, together with any amendments and any additional agreements you may enter into with ShareNest in connection with the Service, will constitute the entire agreement between you and ShareNest concerning the Service. If any provision of these Terms is deemed invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of this Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect. No waiver of any sections of these Terms shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and ShareNest’s failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right of provision. We may provide notifications, whether these are required by law of are for marketing or other business related purposes, to you via email notice, written or hard copy notice, or through posting of such notice on our website, as determined by us in our sole discretion.</p>
          <p>Please contact us at <%= link_to "info@sharenest.com", "mailto:?toinfo@sharenest.com" %> with any questions regarding these Terms.</p>
